# Programming for Data Science

Introduction: The Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program offers learners the opportunity to learn the most
important programming languages used by data scientists today. Get started with the fascinating field of data science and
learn Python, SQL, terminal, and Git with the help of experienced instructors. Learners will emerge prepared to tackle real
world data analysis problems.







## project 1: Investigate a Database.

In this project, learners will work with a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. Theyâ€™ll complete
the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer
questions, and finishing by sharing findings.





## project 2: Explore US Bikeshare Data.

Learners will use Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three
US cities. They will write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive
experience in the terminal that presents the answers to your questions.
